# BLTQuest1982
Text-based sandwich making simulator

The object of this game is to make a BLT.

The player interacts with the world by typing one word commands into the text field. I meant to add a
Help command, but I ran out of time.

The main commands are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. You can also USE and OPEN and CLOSE, and type the name of an object to interact with it. I made words you could interact with bold, so hopefully that helps. You can also SAVE, LOAD and RESET the game.

There are many ways to complete the game. One way is as follows. From the start in the food prep area.
